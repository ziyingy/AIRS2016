We suppose that the similarity scores generated for a query divide
the document ranking -- the {\emph{run}} -- into groups in which all
of the documents have the same score.
Let $b_i$ be the rank in the run at which the $i$\,th equi-score
group commences, with, by definition, $b_1=1$.
That is, the $i$\,th group of tied dcouments spans the items
$[b_i\ldots b_{i+1}-1]$, and contains $b_{i+1}-b_i$ documents.
For example, consider the run with scores shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-example}.
In this example, the top-$10$ document ranking (with documemts
labeled consecutively for convenience of reference) is assumed to
contain five different computed similarity scores.
The last row shows a presumed relevance value for each
corresponding document, with ``$0$'' indicating not relevant and
``$1$'' indicating relevant.
If the scores are ignored and only the list of relevance values is
available, computation of the metric precision at depth $k=5$ (P@$5$)
yields a score of $2/5=0.4$, because there are two ``$1$''s
among the first five gain values.
Similarly, the ranking has a reciprocal rank (RR) score of
$1/3=0.333$, since the first relevant document appears at rank $k=3$.
Other metrics such as average precision (AP), rank-biased precision
(RBP), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), can also be
computed, based solely on the ``gain'' row, without consideration of
the document labels or their actual scores.

When scores are include in the evaluation, the situation changes.
Now documents E and F in the example have the same similarity score,
and are part of the third tied group.
That means that P@$5$ might be either $2/5$ or $3/5$, depending on
the tie-breaking rule employed to order E and F.
Similarly, RR might be $1/2$ or $1/3$, because of the tie between B
and C and D, but RR cannot be $1/4$.
