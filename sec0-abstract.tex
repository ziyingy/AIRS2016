We explore the implications of tied scores arising in the document
similarity scoring regimes that are used when queries are processed
in a retrieval engine.
Our investigation has two parts: first, we evaluate past TREC runs to
determine the prevalence and impact of tied scores, to understand the
alternative treatments that might be used to handle them; and second,
we explore the implications of what might be thought of as
``deliberate'' tied scores, in order to allow for faster search.
We show that {\alistair{we end up knowing something, we hope}}.
