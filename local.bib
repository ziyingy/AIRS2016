abstract = {Abstract.
The Information Retrieval community uses a variety of performance
measures to evaluate the effectiveness of scoring functions.
In this paper, we show how to adapt six popular measures, precision,
recall, F1, average precision, reciprocal rank, and normalized
discounted cumulative gain, to cope with scoring functions that are
likely to assign many tied scores to the results of a search.
Tied scores impose only a partial ordering on the results, meaning
that there are multiple possible orderings of the result set, each
one performing differently.
One approach to cope with ties would be to average the performance
values across all possible result orderings; but unfortunately,
generating result permutations requires super-exponential time.
The approach presented in this paper computes precisely the same
performance value as the approach of averaging over all permutations,
but does so as effciently as the original, tie-oblivious
measures.},
